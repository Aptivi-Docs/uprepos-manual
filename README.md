# ðŸ‘‹ Welcome!

Welcome to `uprepos`, which is a very small `bash` script that lets you update all your repositories found under a folder containing all your Git repositories.

To use this script, you can just use:

```shell
$ uprepos
$ uprepos Path/To/Repos
```

To learn how to use this script, go to any link in the left side of your screen.
